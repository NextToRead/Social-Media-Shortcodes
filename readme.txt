A basic Wordpress Plugin that creates shortcodes for profile links to various social media websites. I'll work on my readme more later.

Example 1:

[twitter name="JoeSomeone" text="some text you want the link to appear as"] 

results in:

<a href="http://www.twitter.com/JoeSomeone" title="JoeSomeone's Twitter profile\">some text you want the link to appear as</a>

on your post/page

Example 2:

[twitter name="JoeSomeone"]

results in:

<a href="http://www.twitter.com/JoeSomeone" title="JoeSomeone's Twitter profile\">JoeSomeone (Twitter)</a>

on your post/page.
